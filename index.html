<p>Satellite platforms are getting better and cheaper to build and launch. New platforms have higher resolution, collect images with greater frequency and collect new types of data, allowing new insights.</p>
<h4 id="typical-serviced-image-">Typical serviced image.</h4>
<p>A typical serviced satellite image (bought or downloaded) includes several processing steps. From the raw image (<em>Level 0</em>) band images are combined to produce a color image in calibrated units (called <em>Level 1</em> processing), and the image is geolocated and ortho-rectified following an elevation model of the terrain or Ground Control Points (GCP) with a certain Accuracy, under a geodetic reference frame (E.g. Mercator). For big areas, several captures need to be stitched together. This product is usually referred as <em>Level 2</em> or similar. In many cases, the end user often only sees the final map image, either in a report, or as an interactive map on the web, like the maps in this page.</p>
<h5 id="data-license">Data License</h5>
<p>An important factor regarding the use of satellite images is the License of the data. It is important to understand the limitations, reusability and shareability of the data. For open data, like Landsat, there are no restriction of use. For a typical high-resolution image purchase, usage is restricted to a project, and only rendered maps are publishable. Sometimes tracing rights for open platforms is granted, but License terms vary widely on a user or usage base.</p>
<h5 id="tasking-versus-archive">Tasking versus Archive</h5>
<p>Typically serviced data come from filtering the requested locations and selecting available times from the satellite archives. Sometimes new images need to be collected (e.g. for monitoring, disaster recovery or similar). In these cases prices and quality are very different since it&#39;s subject to orbital, cloud coverage or other constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong> refers to the size one pixel in the image has on the ground. For example 15 meters means that one pixel on the image corresponds to a square of 15 by 15 meters on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Pansharpening</strong>. Often satellites take images of lower resolution in many bands (e.g. Multispectral red, green and blue for a color image), and then have another channel with much wider spectral range (i.e. &quot;panchromatic&quot;) with finer resolution. By means of a mathematical relations, it is possible to <em>pan-sharpen</em> the multispectral image with the panchromatic resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong>. Resolution refers to the size of the pixel. Accuracy refers to the possible difference between the reported locations on the images and their actual location in the real world. A usual standard is a 90% likelihood within a Circular Area around the location (CE90). To ensure accuracy, satellite images are ortho-rectified for orography with either an elevation model, or using Ground Control Points (GCP).</p>

<p>Many modern satellites collect infrared and ultraviolet light not visible to the human eye. This information can be used to measure vegetation health, to monitor biomass, or to track forest fires. Newer laser and Radar-based sensors precisely scan the earth, eliminating weather dependencies, producing 3D earth models, and enabling better change detection.</p>
<p>In this imagery over rural Uganda, infrared sensors augment imagery to highlight vegetation (False Color) and to measure the health of that vegetation (NDVI). These images show a range of imagery resolutions from different growing seasons.</p>

<h3 id="insights-from-invisible-light">Insights from invisible light</h3>
<p>Many satellites capture wavelengths such as infrared or ultraviolet light that can help to understand characteristics of the surface substances.  Different objects reflect these light frequencies in different ways. Common satellite analysis techniques combine visible and invisible light bands (called &quot;spectral bands&quot;) to characterize it. For example, spectral bands covering frequencies in the middle-infrared wavelength regions are responsive to moisture content in vegetation, forest canopy and soil, while near infrared wavelength regions tend to emphasize vegetation health and&#8212; at a courser scale&#8212; overall biomass.</p>
<p>Taken together, the spectral response of each band creates a unique signature, referred to as its spectral curve. The information it communicates can help to separate different types of land cover or derive information about the conditions within a single type of land cover.</p>

<p>A simple form of image interpretation involves assigning invisible light bands to Red, Green, and Blue channels to create a false color image to highlight certain characteristics. False color images can distinguish muddy water from muddy land, pinpoint fires, or clearly show the extent of a growing city. This example combines the moisture sensitivity of Mid-Infrared reflectance with the vegetation sensitivity of Near-Infrared to highlight agricultural fields.</p>

<p>In addition to False Color composition, spectral bands can be combined mathematically to emphasize a particular set of characteristics. These techniques draw from all relevant bands, rather than the three band limits of false color analysis, to draw out very specific characteristics. These techniques involve greater processing of raw data in order to leverage all available data to cluster signals and minimize noise. While false color can be used to identify agricultural fields, mathematic transformations can detect the health of each field. While false color can distinguish mud from water, mathematic transformations can tell you how wet the mud is.</p>

Advanced techniques compare data pixel by pixel, compare imagery taken at different times or different angles, or combining multiple source datasets. These techniques often result in data products like 3D terrain maps, the footprints of buildings, or the surface type of the road network. These techniques are most computationally intensive and require significant processing resources.

New delivery models are not limited to raw imagery. As the value of raw pixels declines, there is greater innovation and competition to provide data products derived from imagery.</p>
<h3 id="new-business-models-are-making-imagery-more-accessible-to-development-partners-new-open-data-sources-are-coming-available-">New business models are making imagery more accessible to development partners. New open data sources are coming available.</h3>
<p>Partnership purchase - Providers are considering new pricing options that make older imagery available for free or at significant discounts. For example, discussions are underway to streamline new licensing models that allow products licensed to the development partner to be accessed by the development partner&#39;s clients in country.</p>
<p>Imagery &quot;rental&quot; - As providers offer analytical and processing services they will create business and pricing models to accompany these services. In some cases analytical tools may come at a premium. Eventually these services will drop in cost. Providers will offer analytical products derived from imagery for less than the cost of the raw imagery itself.</p>
<p>New open satellite systems - Several new satellite systems are coming online, offering open information for development use. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ESA’s Copernicus system will deploy six Sentinel satellites between 2014 and 2021 to monitor land, ocean, emergency response, atmosphere, security and climate change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NASA’s satellite launches last year with data to come online with information on climate change. Data from the Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory, Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive are now coming online.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>More regular imagery makes it possible to monitor the progress of infrastructure projects. High resolution imagery and video can help to measure traffic on roads and road quality. Satellite data and analysis can provide the underlying data to inform infrasturcture investments.</p>
<p>As exemplified in the maps below, in countries lacking infrastructure maps, imagery could offer a cheap way to map the national road network. The highest commercial resolution imagery today (0.3 meters) allows for the detection of narrow, unpaved footpaths. These become invisible at 1.5 meters, at which point the gridded residential roads are the smallest observable feature. This grid remains recognizable at 2.5 meters, but is more likely to confuse with the surrounding vegetation. At 5-meter resolution, even the relatively large secondary road which cuts through the neighborhood becomes difficult to reliably distinguish, making the single primary road which travels the length of Palawan the only visible linear feature.</p>

<p>Due to the massive size and limited accessibility of forests, satellites have long been an indispensable tool for forest management. Satellite imagery derived forest maps measure increases in greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, detect illegal logging activities, evaluate the availability and use of wood as cooking fuel, and assess the environmental impact of infrastructure projects such as road construction.</p>
<p>In agriculture, satellite imagery measures agricultural productivity. Imagery shows crop type and area of coverage, estimates rainfall, measures the effectiveness of irrigation systems, and evaluates the risk of droughts and floods. Satellite data is used for everything from developing insurance products for small farmers and early warning systems to detect decreasing agricultural production.</p>
<p>High frequency multispectral imagery creates significant opportunities for Forest and Agriculture projects. Regular imaging of rural areas in developing countries will yield comparable data at regular intervals unlocking new types of analysis of forest change and trends in agricultural production. More immediate information on crop health is critical to enable warning systems for potential drops in production in food sectors. Automated change detection will be invaluable in monitoring huge swaths of forest and agricultural areas.</p>

            <h3 id="disaster-reduction-and-response">Disaster Reduction and Response</h3>
<p>Disaster events tend to affect large areas. The impact of such events can disrupt the normal functioning and organization of local authorities. Remote sensing information is immensely useful to gain oversight of the current situation after an event and to identify areas that are most affected. In the agriculture sector, remote sensing data is increasingly used for estimating crop yields to develop early warning systems for famines. Satellite image based coastline displacement and river bank erosion monitoring is also an important instrument to measure vulnerability of urban areas to flooding, storm surges, and tsunamis. While urban land cover maps are used to estimate impervious surfaces to track and manage water runoff patterns and sewer systems. Satellite imagery contributing to the mapping of informal settlements also helps access vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Daily imaging will make it possible to prepare for, and track disasters as they occur. To &quot;rewind&quot; to immediately before a disaster, and support the recovery process. Time is a critical factor for disaster response. The quicker images can be distributed to measure impact and develop response strategies. Recent events such as the Nepal earthquake show the importance and usefulness of near real time satellite imagery. Having images taken shortly after disaster events can be immensely helpful to assist disaster response on the ground. Such images inform damage assessments and provide information on what infrastructure still exists for rescue efforts to reach affected areas. Better distribution approaches will be critical in allowing satellite data and analysis to get to responders as quickly as possible. Furthermore, before disasters happen, satellite images can provide means to reduce the vulnerabilities, and prepare for different scenarios. E.g. high resolution digital elevation maps are critical for evaluating the risk of floods, landslides, and earthquakes.</p>
