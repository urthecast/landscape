## Sharper. Richer. Every Day.

Satellite platforms are getting better and cheaper to build and launch. New platforms have higher resolution, collect images with greater frequency and collect new types of data, allowing new insights.

#### Typical serviced image.

A typical serviced satellite image (bought or downloaded) includes several processing steps. From the raw image (*Level 0*) band images are combined to produce a color image in calibrated units (called *Level 1* processing), and the image is geolocated and ortho-rectified following an elevation model of the terrain or Ground Control Points (GCP) with a certain Accuracy, under a geodetic reference frame (E.g. Mercator). For big areas, several captures need to be stitched together. This product is usually referred as *Level 2* or similar. In many cases, the end user often only sees the final map image, either in a report, or as an interactive map on the web, like the maps in this page.

##### Data License

An important factor regarding the use of satellite images is the License of the data. It is important to understand the limitations, reusability and shareability of the data. For open data, like Landsat, there are no restriction of use. For a typical high-resolution image purchase, usage is restricted to a project, and only rendered maps are publishable. Sometimes tracing rights for open platforms is granted, but License terms vary widely on a user or usage base.

##### Tasking versus Archive

Typically serviced data come from filtering the requested locations and selecting available times from the satellite archives. Sometimes new images need to be collected (e.g. for monitoring, disaster recovery or similar). In these cases prices and quality are very different since it's subject to orbital, cloud coverage or other constraints.
