##### PCA
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) decorrelates the data within each spectral band, such that the most common characteristics of all bands are placed in the highest category and less common characteristics are placed in lower categories until all variance is explained. It is invaluable for exploration of data and landscape characteristics, simultaneously drawing attention to the most noteworthy and best-hidden features in a scene.
