### Accounting of transportation networks 

More regular imagery makes it possible to monitor the progress of infrastructure projects. High resolution imagery and video can help to measure traffic on roads and road quality. Satellite data and analysis can provide the underlying data to inform infrasturcture investments.

As exemplified in the maps below, in countries lacking infrastructure maps, imagery could offer a cheap way to map the national road network. The highest commercial resolution imagery today (0.3 meters) allows for the detection of narrow, unpaved footpaths. These become invisible at 1.5 meters, at which point the gridded residential roads are the smallest observable feature. This grid remains recognizable at 2.5 meters, but is more likely to confuse with the surrounding vegetation. At 5-meter resolution, even the relatively large secondary road which cuts through the neighborhood becomes difficult to reliably distinguish, making the single primary road which travels the length of Palawan the only visible linear feature.
