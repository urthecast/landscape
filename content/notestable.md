*Notes on the table*: **Satellite** refers to the main optical instrument onboard. **Operational** indicates satellite status. **Open Data** refers to no data costs or license restrictions to download and use ortho-rectified data. **Spatial resolution** is ground sampling at nadir for (pansharpened) data. **Revisit data** is time between orbital overpass from equatorial ground. **Cost** refers to order of magnitude cost for archived data. Typically cost can vary depending on resolution, instrument, processing, minimum area, license and distributions rights, or other factors.
