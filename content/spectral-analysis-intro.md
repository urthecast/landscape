## Deeper and cheaper analysis on the cloud.

#### Massive cloud computing resources and analytical tools for working with big datasets make it possible extract new information from imagery.

The combination of new sensors, deeper archives, and better computing ability make it possible to draw sophisticated information from satellite imagery. Development partners can now process imagery on the cloud and don't need to invest in expensive hardware and software.

### Insights from invisible light

Many satellites capture wavelengths such as infrared or ultraviolet light that can help to understand characteristics of the surface substances.  Different objects reflect these light frequencies in different ways. Common satellite analysis techniques combine visible and invisible light bands (called "spectral bands") to characterize it. For example, spectral bands covering frequencies in the middle-infrared wavelength regions are responsive to moisture content in vegetation, forest canopy and soil, while near infrared wavelength regions tend to emphasize vegetation health and&#8212; at a courser scale&#8212; overall biomass.

Taken together, the spectral response of each band creates a unique signature, referred to as its spectral curve. The information it communicates can help to separate different types of land cover or derive information about the conditions within a single type of land cover.
