| ![Elevation and Surface mapping](assets/graphics/content/feature_extraction.png) | **Elevation and Surface** Elevation and Surface models are constructed by calculating the offset in radar or image-based data acquired from different angles. 3D terrain models are used to measure landslide or flood risk. 3D urban models are used to measure and manage vertical growth of cities. |
| ![Change detection](assets/graphics/content/change_detection.png)| **Change Detection**  Analysis of imagery from different time periods to detect and understand changes. Examples include urban growth, deforestation, ice melting, landslide detection, or tracking urban conflict. |
| ![Feature extraction and counting](assets/graphics/content/similar_objects.png)| **Feature Extraction**  Analysis of imagery to extract and identify features.  These can include man-made objects (buildings, roads, structures) and natural objects (Ex: land use, water extent, crop areas). Once extracted these items can be sorted, counted, and analyzed |
