### Advanced analysis

Advanced analytical techniques go beyond inter-band math. Advanced techniques compare data pixel by pixel, compare imagery taken at different times or different angles, or combining multiple source datasets. These techniques often result in data products like 3D terrain maps, the footprints of buildings, or the surface type of the road network. These techniques are most computationally intensive and require significant processing resources. The availability of elastic cloud computing has made these techniques more practical for development organizations.
