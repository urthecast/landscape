##### False color
A simple form of image interpretation involves assigning invisible light bands to Red, Green, and Blue channels to create a false color image to highlight certain characteristics. False color images can distinguish muddy water from muddy land, pinpoint fires, or clearly show the extent of a growing city. This example combines the moisture sensitivity of Mid-Infrared reflectance with the vegetation sensitivity of Near-Infrared to highlight agricultural fields.
