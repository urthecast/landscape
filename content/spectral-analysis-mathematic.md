#### Mathematic spectral transformations

In addition to False Color composition, spectral bands can be combined mathematically to emphasize a particular set of characteristics. These techniques draw from all relevant bands, rather than the three band limits of false color analysis, to draw out very specific characteristics. These techniques involve greater processing of raw data in order to leverage all available data to cluster signals and minimize noise. While false color can be used to identify agricultural fields, mathematic transformations can detect the health of each field. While false color can distinguish mud from water, mathematic transformations can tell you how wet the mud is.
