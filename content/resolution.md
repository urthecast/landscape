### Resolution
#### High resolution commercial imagery is available up to .31m resolution.
While there is still a premium for the highest resolution imagery (<0.50m), medium to low resolution is suitable for many applications, and increasingly affordable or available at no cost.

#### What resolution do I need?
The imagery samples below can help select the right imagery for your project.

In an urban environment like Fortaleza, free Landsat imagery (15m) shows the extent of the city. Medium resolution imagery like RapidEye (5m) shows roads. With Worldview 3 (.31m) and Pleiades (.5m) images you can count beach umbrellas.
