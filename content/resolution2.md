#### Resolution versus accuracy

**Resolution** refers to the size one pixel in the image has on the ground. For example 15 meters means that one pixel on the image corresponds to a square of 15 by 15 meters on the ground.

**Pansharpening**. Often satellites take images of lower resolution in many bands (e.g. Multispectral red, green and blue for a color image), and then have another channel with much wider spectral range (i.e. "panchromatic") with finer resolution. By means of a mathematical relations, it is possible to *pan-sharpen* the multispectral image with the panchromatic resolution.

**Accuracy**. Resolution refers to the size of the pixel. Accuracy refers to the possible difference between the reported locations on the images and their actual location in the real world. A usual standard is a 90% likelihood within a Circular Area around the location (CE90). To ensure accuracy, satellite images are ortho-rectified for orography with either an elevation model, or using Ground Control Points (GCP).
