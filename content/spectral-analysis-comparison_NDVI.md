##### Vegetation Indices 
Multiplying the data from spectral bands in different combinations produces an index that can be used to compare every point in an image on the same scale. The most common indexes measure vegetation health and distinguish between types of plants, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).
