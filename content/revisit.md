### Revisit (Temporal Resolution)

Increased capture capacity for large satellites and new microsatellite platforms offer frequent revisit rates and more extensive image capture, allowing high frequency monitoring of changes on earth. More regular data makes it easier to study change over time, to track the progress of projects, and to “rewind” to the days leading up to a disaster.
